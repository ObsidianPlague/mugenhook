Expand M.U.G.E.N engine!

MugenHook is a project aiming to add more features to the engine, this includes
animated portraits, icons, multiple characters per slot and more!


# What does it add?

## Announcers
Custom sounds can be assigned to any cell, effectively creating character announcers.
Multiple ways to set up, one including reading sounds from character file.

## Animated Portraits
Character portraits can now be fully animated, optionally with animation changing 
upon selection. 

## Sliding Portraits
Character portraits can now slide on screen, with various ways to set up.
Slide once on mode selection or slide on each cursor change!

## Animated Icons
Character icons can now be fully animated in various ways, play once, loop anim or 
play animation upon variation selection.

## Variations
With this feature, you can place multiple characacters in one slot. Limit is 255, 
double pressing START will move to the next entry in the slot.

## String Swaps
You can change value of many hardcoded strings, such as button names or game mode 
names.

## Tag Restoration
Tag mode (cut from 1.1) is restored and can be fully utilized. A new CNS param 'tag' was 
added which allows you to check if mode is tag.

**NOTE: This feature is for scripters! Enabling it does not mean that it will be possible to swap 
characters during game**

## Stage Announcer
Each stage can use a seperate sound.

## Magic Boxes
Allows to make timed cells in select screen, works exactly like Smoke in Mortal Kombat 3.


## Various Tweaks
Main menu can be scrolled using LEFT/RIGHT instead of UP/DOWN, game modes can be hid,
game mode player amount can be changed and more!
